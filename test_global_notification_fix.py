üéØ TEST THE GLOBAL NOTIFICATION FIX:

1. üì± RESTART YOUR APP:
   - Close the app completely
   - Restart to ensure global listener is set up
   - This is critical for the fix to work

2. üîî TEST NOTIFICATION FLOW:
   - Login as dietician
   - Upload a new diet for user EMoXb6rFuwN3xKsotq54K0kVArf1
   - Login as that user
   - Wait for notification

3. ‚úÖ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
   - Global listener receives notification
   - Stores flag in AsyncStorage
   - DashboardScreen checks AsyncStorage
   - Popup appears when user navigates to Dashboard

4. üîç CHECK RAILWAY LOGS:
   Look for these new logs:
   
   ‚úÖ GLOBAL LISTENER LOGS:
   - 'üåç GLOBAL NOTIFICATION RECEIVED: New Diet Has Arrived!'
   - 'üåç New diet notification received globally for user: EMoXb6rFuwN3xKsotq54K0kVArf1'
   - 'üåç Stored pending auto extract flag for DashboardScreen'
   - 'üì± FRONTEND EVENT LOG: GLOBAL_NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED'
   
   ‚úÖ DASHBOARD LOGS:
   - 'Auto extraction pending detected from global notification, showing popup'
   - 'üì± FRONTEND EVENT LOG: POPUP_TRIGGERED_GLOBAL_NOTIFICATION'

5. üéØ TEST SCENARIOS:
   - App closed when diet arrives ‚Üí open app ‚Üí navigate to Dashboard ‚Üí popup appears
   - App open on different screen ‚Üí notification arrives ‚Üí navigate to Dashboard ‚Üí popup appears
   - App open on Dashboard ‚Üí notification arrives ‚Üí popup appears immediately

6. üö® IF STILL NOT WORKING:
   - Check if global listener is being set up in App.tsx
   - Verify notification permissions are granted
   - Check if AsyncStorage is working
   - Look for any error logs in Railway

7. ‚úÖ SUCCESS INDICATORS:
   - Global notification logs appear in Railway
   - Dashboard popup logs appear in Railway
   - Popup shows when navigating to Dashboard
   - No more missing frontend event logs

‚úÖ Global notification listener is properly set up

‚úÖ AsyncStorage flag system is implemented
‚úÖ Backend logging is configured

1. Restart your app completely
2. Test the notification flow
3. Check Railway logs for global listener activity
4. Verify popup appears when navigating to Dashboard
