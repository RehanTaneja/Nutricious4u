# 🔧 MESSAGE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM - COMPREHENSIVE FIX

## 📋 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The message notification system has been **completely fixed** with all critical issues resolved. The system now properly sends notifications between users and dieticians with correct recipient targeting.

---

## 🎯 **PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

### **Problem 1: Missing Flags in Notification Data** ❌ → ✅
**Issue**: Backend was sending notifications without `fromDietician` or `fromUser` flags.

**Impact**: Frontend notification handlers couldn't identify who sent the message, so notifications were never displayed to the correct recipient.

**Fix**: Updated `SimpleNotificationService.send_message_notification()` to include proper flags:
- When dietician sends to user: `fromDietician: true`
- When user sends to dietician: `fromUser: <user_id>`

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/services/simple_notification_service.py` (lines 157-202)

---

### **Problem 2: Dietician Recipient Handling** ❌ → ✅
**Issue**: When recipient ID was "dietician", the system tried to look it up as a regular user ID instead of using the special dietician token lookup.

**Impact**: Notifications to dietician would fail because "dietician" is not a valid user ID.

**Fix**: Updated `SimpleNotificationService.get_user_token()` to handle "dietician" as a special case and use `get_dietician_notification_token()` function.

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/services/simple_notification_service.py` (lines 25-75)

---

### **Problem 3: Missing Sender Tracking** ❌ → ✅
**Issue**: Sender user ID was not being passed through the notification pipeline.

**Impact**: Notifications couldn't properly identify who sent them for tracking purposes.

**Fix**: Added `sender_user_id` parameter throughout the pipeline:
- Backend endpoint accepts `senderUserId` 
- Notification service includes it in data payload
- Frontend API sends it with requests

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/server.py` (line 2775)
- `backend/services/simple_notification_service.py` (line 157)
- `mobileapp/services/api.ts` (line 1173)

## ✅ **COMPLETE NOTIFICATION FLOW**

### **User → Dietician Flow:**
```
1. User sends message in DieticianMessageScreen
   ↓
2. Frontend calls sendMessageNotification(
     recipientId: "dietician",
     senderName: "User Name",
     message: "Hello!",
     senderUserId: user.uid,
     isDietician: false
   )
   ↓
3. Backend receives at /notifications/send
   ↓
4. Backend calls get_user_token("dietician")
   → Recognizes "dietician" as special case
   → Calls get_dietician_notification_token()
   → Returns dietician's push token
   ↓
5. Backend sends notification with data:
   {
     type: "message_notification",
     senderName: "User Name",
     message: "Hello!",
     fromUser: user.uid,  ← CRITICAL FLAG
     timestamp: "..."
   }
   ↓
6. Dietician's device receives notification
   ↓
7. DieticianDashboard notification handler detects:
   data?.type === 'message_notification' && data?.fromUser
   ↓
8. Shows alert: "You have a new message from User Name"
```

### **Dietician → User Flow:**
```
1. Dietician sends message in DieticianMessageScreen
   ↓
2. Frontend calls sendMessageNotification(
     recipientId: userId,
     senderName: "Dietician",
     message: "Hello!",
     senderUserId: dietician.uid,
     isDietician: true
   )
   ↓
3. Backend receives at /notifications/send
   ↓
4. Backend calls get_user_token(userId)
   → Looks up user in user_profiles collection
   → Returns user's push token
   ↓
5. Backend sends notification with data:
   {
     type: "message_notification",
     senderName: "Dietician",
     message: "Hello!",
     fromDietician: true,  ← CRITICAL FLAG
     timestamp: "..."
   }
   ↓
6. User's device receives notification
   ↓
7. User DashboardScreen notification handler detects:
   data?.type === 'message_notification' && data?.fromDietician
   ↓
8. Shows alert: "You have a new message from your dietician"
```

### **Backend Changes:**

1. **`backend/services/simple_notification_service.py`**
   - Lines 25-75: Updated `get_user_token()` to handle "dietician" recipient
   - Lines 157-202: Updated `send_message_notification()` to include proper flags
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout

2. **`backend/server.py`**
   - Line 2775: Pass `senderUserId` to notification service
   - Lines 2841-2910: Added debug endpoint `/notifications/debug/token/{user_id}`

### **Frontend Changes:**

3. **`mobileapp/services/api.ts`**
   - Line 1173: Include `senderUserId` in API request payload

### **Verification Added:**

4. **`test_message_notifications_api.py`**
   - Comprehensive test script for API-based testing
   - Tests both user→dietician and dietician→user flows
   - Checks token status for both parties

---

## 🧪 **TESTING & VERIFICATION**

### **Backend Test Script:**
```bash
cd /path/to/project
python3 test_message_notifications_api.py
```

**What it tests:**
- ✅ Backend health check
- ✅ Token status for dietician
- ✅ Token status for users
- ✅ User → Dietician notification API
- ✅ Dietician → User notification API

### **Debug Endpoint:**
Check token status for any user:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/notifications/debug/token/dietician
curl http://localhost:8000/notifications/debug/token/<user_id>
```

### **Manual Testing Steps:**

1. **Ensure tokens are registered:**
   - Dietician logs into mobile app → Token saved to Firestore
   - User logs into mobile app → Token saved to Firestore

2. **Test User → Dietician:**
   - User sends message to dietician
   - Dietician should see notification on device
   - Notification should say "You have a new message from [User Name]"

3. **Test Dietician → User:**
   - Dietician sends message to user
   - User should see notification on device
   - Notification should say "You have a new message from your dietician"

4. **Verify in Backend Logs:**
   - Look for `[SimpleNotification]` log entries
   - Check for "Setting fromDietician=True" or "Setting fromUser=..."
   - Verify "Notification sent successfully" messages

---

## 🔍 **DEBUGGING TIPS**

### **If notifications still not working:**

1. **Check tokens are registered:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/notifications/debug/token/dietician
   ```
   Should return `tokenFound: true`

2. **Check backend logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f backend/server.log | grep "SimpleNotification"
   ```
   Look for errors or warnings

3. **Verify mobile app setup:**
   - Check that `registerForPushNotificationsAsync()` is called after login
   - Verify notification handlers are set up in dashboard screens
   - Check that notifications permission is granted on device

4. **Test with debug endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/notifications/send \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "recipientId": "dietician",
       "type": "message",
       "message": "Test message",
       "senderName": "Test User",
       "isDietician": false,
       "senderUserId": "test123"
     }'
   ```

---

## ✨ **KEY IMPROVEMENTS**

1. **Proper Flag System**: Messages now include `fromDietician` or `fromUser` flags
2. **Special Recipient Handling**: "dietician" recipient is properly handled
3. **Sender Tracking**: Full sender information included in notifications
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging
5. **Debug Endpoint**: Easy way to check token status
6. **Test Scripts**: Automated testing for both notification flows

---

## 📱 **NOTIFICATION HANDLERS (Verified)**

All notification handlers are correctly implemented and looking for the right flags:

### **User Dashboard** (`mobileapp/screens.tsx:1386`)
```typescript
if (data?.type === 'message_notification' && data?.fromDietician) {
  Alert.alert(
    'New Message',
    'You have a new message from your dietician',
    [
      { text: 'View Message', onPress: () => navigation.navigate('DieticianMessage') },
      { text: 'OK', style: 'default' }
    ]
  );
}
```

### **Dietician Dashboard** (`mobileapp/screens.tsx:11554`)
```typescript
if (data?.type === 'message_notification' && data?.fromUser) {
  Alert.alert(
    'New Message',
    `You have a new message from ${data.senderName || 'a user'}`,
    [
      { text: 'View Messages', onPress: () => navigation.navigate('Messages') },
      { text: 'OK', style: 'default' }
    ]
  );
}
```
