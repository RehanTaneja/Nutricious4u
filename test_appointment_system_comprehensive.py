Comprehensive Appointment Scheduling System Test
===============================================

This script tests the complete appointment scheduling system to ensure:
1. Firebase permissions are working correctly
2. Users can see all appointments and breaks
3. Users can book appointments successfully
4. Real-time updates work properly
5. The system matches the dietician dashboard view
