üéØ TEST THE FIXED POPUP SYSTEM:

1. üì± RESTART YOUR APP:
   - Close the app completely
   - Restart to clear any cached listeners
   - This ensures clean state

2. üîî TEST NOTIFICATION FLOW:
   - Login as dietician
   - Upload a new diet for a specific user
   - Login as that user
   - Wait for notification

3. ‚úÖ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
   - Notification should be received
   - Popup should appear on Dashboard
   - No duplicate processing
   - No race conditions
   - Clean console logs

4. üîç CHECK CONSOLE LOGS:
   Look for these logs (should be clean now):
   - '[NOTIFICATION DEBUG] DashboardScreen listener triggered'
   - '[NOTIFICATION DEBUG] User ID match: true'
   - '[NOTIFICATION DEBUG] Dashboard processing new_diet notification'
   - '[Dashboard] Notification data: {auto_extract_pending: true, ...}'
   - 'setShowAutoExtractionPopup(true)' being called

5. üö´ SHOULD NOT SEE:
   - Multiple listener triggers
   - Conflicting popup state changes
   - Race condition errors
   - Duplicate processing

6. üéØ TEST SCENARIOS:
   - App closed when diet arrives ‚Üí open app ‚Üí popup appears
   - App open when diet arrives ‚Üí popup appears immediately
   - Click "Extract Reminders" ‚Üí loading states work ‚Üí success popup
   - Click "Later" ‚Üí popup closes ‚Üí reopens on next app launch
   - After extraction ‚Üí popup doesn't appear again

7. üîß IF STILL NOT WORKING:
   - Check user ID mismatch
   - Verify notification permissions
   - Check network connectivity
   - Test with fresh diet upload
   - Check console logs for specific errors

8. ‚úÖ SUCCESS INDICATORS:
   - Popup appears when expected
   - No duplicate listeners in console
   - Clean notification processing
   - Proper state management
   - No race conditions
