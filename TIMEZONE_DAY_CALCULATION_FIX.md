# Timezone Day Calculation Fix

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**
The user reported that notifications were being scheduled for the wrong days:
- Thursday's notifications were being scheduled for Wednesday
- Friday's notifications were being scheduled for Thursday
- Saturday's notifications were being scheduled for Friday

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Timezone Issue**
The problem was in the day calculation logic in `backend/services/notification_scheduler.py`. The system was using UTC timezone for day calculations, but the diet plans are in IST (Indian Standard Time). This caused a mismatch where:

1. **Current time**: Thursday in UTC
2. **Diet time**: Thursday in IST (which is actually Friday in UTC)
3. **Result**: Notifications were being scheduled for the wrong day

### **Example of the Problem**
```
Current UTC: 2025-08-14 16:57:30 (Thursday)
Current IST: 2025-08-14 22:27:30 (Thursday)

When scheduling Thursday notifications:
- Old logic used UTC weekday (3 = Thursday)
- But the diet is in IST timezone
- This caused notifications to be scheduled for the wrong day
```

## ✅ **Fix Implemented**

### **File**: `backend/services/notification_scheduler.py`

#### **Before**: UTC-based day calculation
```python
# Get current time in UTC
now = datetime.now(pytz.UTC)

# Calculate next occurrence of this day and time
days_ahead = (day - now.weekday()) % 7
if days_ahead == 0 and now.time() >= target_time:
    days_ahead = 7

next_occurrence = now + timedelta(days=days_ahead)
next_occurrence = next_occurrence.replace(
    hour=target_time.hour, 
    minute=target_time.minute, 
    second=0, 
    microsecond=0
)
```

#### **After**: IST-based day calculation
```python
# Get current time in UTC
now = datetime.now(pytz.UTC)

# Use IST (Indian Standard Time) for day calculations since the diet is in IST
ist = pytz.timezone('Asia/Kolkata')
now_ist = now.astimezone(ist)

# Calculate next occurrence of this day and time in IST
days_ahead = (day - now_ist.weekday()) % 7
if days_ahead == 0 and now_ist.time() >= target_time:
    days_ahead = 7

# Calculate the next occurrence in IST
next_occurrence_ist = now_ist + timedelta(days=days_ahead)
next_occurrence_ist = next_occurrence_ist.replace(
    hour=target_time.hour, 
    minute=target_time.minute, 
    second=0, 
    microsecond=0
)

# Convert back to UTC for storage
next_occurrence = next_occurrence_ist.astimezone(pytz.UTC)
```

### **Enhanced Logging**
Added detailed logging to help debug day calculations:
```python
logger.info(f"  Current IST: {now_ist.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z')} (weekday: {now_ist.weekday()})")
logger.info(f"  Target day: {self.days_of_week[day]} (day {day})")
logger.info(f"  Days ahead: {days_ahead}")
logger.info(f"  Next occurrence IST: {next_occurrence_ist.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z')} (weekday: {next_occurrence_ist.weekday()})")
logger.info(f"  Next occurrence UTC: {next_occurrence.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z')} (weekday: {next_occurrence.weekday()})")
```

## 🔄 **How the Fix Works**

### **Step-by-Step Process**
```
1. Get current time in UTC
2. Convert to IST timezone
3. Calculate days ahead using IST weekday
4. Calculate next occurrence in IST
5. Convert back to UTC for storage
6. Store in Firestore with UTC timestamp
```

### **Example with Sample Diet**
```
Diet: THURSDAY- 14th AUG, 5:30 AM- 1 glass JEERA water

Current time: Thursday 22:27 IST
Target time: 05:30 AM
Target day: Thursday (day 3)

Calculation:
- Current IST weekday: 3 (Thursday)
- Target weekday: 3 (Thursday)
- Days ahead: (3 - 3) % 7 = 0, but since 22:27 > 05:30, days_ahead = 7
- Next occurrence: Next Thursday at 05:30 IST
- Convert to UTC: Next Thursday at 00:00 UTC (for storage)
```

## ✅ **Verification Results**

### **Test Results**
```
Current UTC: 2025-08-14 16:57:30 (Thursday)
Current IST: 2025-08-14 22:27:30 (Thursday)

📅 Thursday (day 3):
  Days ahead: 7 (next Thursday)
  Next occurrence IST: 2025-08-21 05:30:00 IST (Thursday)
  Next occurrence UTC: 2025-08-21 00:00:00 UTC (Thursday)

📅 Friday (day 4):
  Days ahead: 1 (tomorrow)
  Next occurrence IST: 2025-08-15 05:30:00 IST (Friday)
  Next occurrence UTC: 2025-08-15 00:00:00 UTC (Friday)
```

## 🎯 **Key Benefits**
