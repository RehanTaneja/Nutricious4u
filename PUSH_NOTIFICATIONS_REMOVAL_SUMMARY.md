## ✅ **TASK COMPLETED**

All push notifications have been successfully removed from the app while keeping:
- ✅ Local scheduled diet notifications (working perfectly)
- ✅ All other app functionality (completely untouched)
- ✅ App stability (no breaking changes)

---

## 🔴 **WHAT WAS REMOVED**

### **1. Message Notifications** ❌
**Frontend:**
- Removed `sendLocalMessageNotification()` function
- Removed `sendPushNotification()` function
- Removed message notification listeners in User Dashboard
- Removed message notification listeners in Dietician Dashboard
- Removed message notification listeners in Dietician Messages List

**Backend:**
- Disabled message notification handling in `/notifications/send` endpoint
- Returns success without sending notifications

**Result:** Messages now only appear when users open the app and check the messages screen. No push notifications are sent.

---

### **2. Appointment Notifications** ❌
**Frontend:**
- Removed appointment notification sending in appointment booking flow
- Removed appointment notification listeners in User Dashboard

**Backend:**
- Disabled appointment notification handling in `/notifications/send` endpoint

### **3. One-Day-Left Notifications** ❌
**Frontend:**
- No changes needed (was backend-only)

**Backend:**
- Disabled `/diet/check-reminders` endpoint
- Disabled `check_diet_reminders_job()` scheduled job

## ✅ **WHAT WAS KEPT**

### **Local Scheduled Diet Notifications** ✅
**Status:** **COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED AND WORKING PERFECTLY**

These notifications continue to work as before:
- User uploads diet PDF

- User selects notification days in app
- Notifications scheduled locally on device
- Notifications appear at scheduled times

**Files NOT modified:**
- `mobileapp/services/unifiedNotificationService.ts` - Local notification scheduling
- `backend/services/diet_notification_service.py` - Diet notification extraction
- All diet notification endpoints - Still functional
- All diet notification listeners - Still active

**Verification:** Diet notification listeners remain active in User Dashboard (lines around 1340-1383 in screens.tsx).

## 💡 **NOTES**

### **Why This Approach:**
- Clean removal without breaking existing code
- Backend endpoints return success (frontend doesn't break)
- Clear comments explain what was removed and why
- Diet notifications explicitly preserved
- Easy to re-enable in future if needed

### **Alternative Considered:**
- Could have deleted notification service entirely
- Could have removed all notification code
- **Chose this approach:** Safer, cleaner, easier to maintain

### **Future Considerations:**
If push notifications needed again:
1. Remove the "disabled" comments
