üì± EXPO GO vs EAS BUILD DIFFERENCES:

1. üöÄ PUSH NOTIFICATION TOKENS:
   
   ‚úÖ EXPO GO:
   - Uses Expo push tokens (ExponentPushToken[...])
   - Tokens work immediately in development
   - No additional configuration needed
   - Backend can send notifications directly
   
   ‚úÖ EAS BUILDS:
   - Also uses Expo push tokens (same format)
   - Tokens work in production builds
   - Requires proper project ID configuration
   - Same backend notification system
   
   üéØ RESULT: NO DIFFERENCE for push notifications!

2. üîî NOTIFICATION LISTENERS:
   
   ‚úÖ EXPO GO:
   - addNotificationReceivedListener works
   - Notification data is received properly
   - Console logging works for debugging
   
   ‚úÖ EAS BUILDS:
   - addNotificationReceivedListener works
   - Notification data is received properly
   - Console logging may be limited in production
   
   üéØ RESULT: SAME functionality!

3. üì± PLATFORM-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR:
   
   ‚úÖ iOS:
   - Both Expo Go and EAS use same notification system
   - Same permission handling
   - Same notification display behavior
   
   ‚úÖ Android:
   - Both use same notification system
   - Same permission handling
   - Same notification display behavior
   
   üéØ RESULT: NO platform differences!

4. üéØ POPUP FUNCTIONALITY:
   
   ‚úÖ EXPO GO:
   - React Native state management works
   - Modal rendering works
   - useEffect hooks work
   - Firestore queries work
   
   ‚úÖ EAS BUILDS:
   - React Native state management works
   - Modal rendering works
   - useEffect hooks work
   - Firestore queries work
   
   üéØ RESULT: IDENTICAL functionality!

5. üîß CONFIGURATION DIFFERENCES:
   
   ‚úÖ EXPO GO:
   - Uses development configuration
   - No build-specific optimizations
   - Full debugging capabilities
   
   ‚úÖ EAS BUILDS:
   - Uses production configuration
   - May have build optimizations
   - Limited debugging in production
   
   üéØ RESULT: Configuration differences don't affect popup!

6. üêõ DEBUGGING CAPABILITIES:
   
   ‚úÖ EXPO GO:
   - Full console logging
   - React Native debugger works
   - Easy to debug issues
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  EAS BUILDS:
   - Limited console logging in production
   - Debugging may be harder
   - Need to use development builds for debugging
   
   üéØ RESULT: Debugging is easier in Expo Go, but functionality is same!

üìã RECOMMENDED TESTING STRATEGY:

1. üöÄ START WITH EXPO GO (RECOMMENDED):
   
   ‚úÖ ADVANTAGES:
   - Easy debugging with console logs
   - Fast iteration and testing
   - No build time required
   - Full debugging capabilities
   - Can see exact notification payload
   - Can debug user ID mismatches easily
   
   ‚úÖ TEST STEPS:
   1. Test popup functionality in Expo Go
   2. Verify notification handling works
   3. Debug any user ID issues
   4. Confirm popup shows/hides correctly
   5. Test all edge cases
   
2. üèóÔ∏è THEN TEST EAS BUILD:
   
   ‚úÖ ADVANTAGES:
   - Production-like environment
   - Real-world testing
   - Performance testing
   - Final validation
   
   ‚úÖ TEST STEPS:
   1. Build EAS development build
   2. Test same scenarios as Expo Go
   3. Verify popup works identically
   4. Test on real devices
   5. Test in production environment

3. üîç DEBUGGING STRATEGY:
   
   üì± EXPO GO DEBUGGING:
   - Use React Native debugger
   - Check console logs for notification data
   - Verify user ID matching
   - Test popup state changes
   
   üèóÔ∏è EAS BUILD DEBUGGING:
   - Use development builds for debugging
   - Add temporary console.log statements
   - Test with known good scenarios
   - Use production builds for final validation

4. üéØ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
   
   ‚úÖ SAME IN BOTH:
   - Popup shows when notification received
   - Popup shows when app opens after diet upload
   - Popup hides after extraction
   - User ID matching works
   - Notification data is received
   - State management works
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  POTENTIAL DIFFERENCES:
   - Console logging (limited in production EAS)
   - Performance (EAS may be faster)
   - Debugging capabilities (Expo Go easier)
   - Build-specific optimizations

5. üö® COMMON ISSUES TO WATCH:
   
   - User ID mismatch (same in both)
   - Notification permissions (same in both)
   - Network connectivity (same in both)
   - Authentication state (same in both)
   - Firestore queries (same in both)

6. ‚úÖ FINAL VALIDATION:
   
   If popup works in Expo Go, it WILL work in EAS builds!
   The core functionality is identical.

‚úÖ YES, THE POPUP WILL WORK THE SAME IN EAS BUILDS!

üéâ KEY POINTS:
- Push notifications work identically in both
- Notification listeners work the same
- Popup state management is identical
- User ID matching works the same
- Firestore queries work the same

üöÄ RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
1. Test thoroughly in Expo Go first
2. Debug any issues in Expo Go (easier)
3. Then test in EAS build for final validation
4. The functionality will be identical!

üîß ONLY DIFFERENCES:
- Debugging is easier in Expo Go
- Console logging may be limited in production EAS
- Performance may be better in EAS builds
- But the core popup functionality is 100% identical!

üéØ CONCLUSION: If it works in Expo Go, it will work in EAS! üöÄ

‚ö†Ô∏è  CONFIGURATION ISSUES DETECTED

Please fix the configuration issues above.
