Final Comprehensive Test for Appointment Scheduling System
========================================================

This script verifies that all the fixes are working correctly:
1. Firestore rules allow users to read all appointments and breaks
2. Users can see their own appointments in green
3. Users can see other users' appointments in grey
4. Dieticians can see all appointments with user names
5. All permissions are working correctly
