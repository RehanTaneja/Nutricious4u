# Booking and Loading Fixes Summary

## üéØ Issues Fixed

‚úÖ **Fixed booking permission errors** - Users can now book appointments successfully  
‚úÖ **Fixed breaks loading delay** - Added loading state to prevent 1-second visibility issue  
‚úÖ **Maintained visual distinction** - Green for own appointments, grey for others  

## üîß Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Booking Permission Error** ‚ùå
**Problem**: Users got "Missing or insufficient permissions" when trying to book appointments.

**Root Cause**: Firestore rules had a logical error in the write permission:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Problematic)
allow write: if request.auth != null && 
  (request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId || ...)
```

**Issue**: When creating a new appointment, `resource.data.userId` doesn't exist yet because the document is being created. The rule was trying to check a field that doesn't exist during creation.

### 2. **Breaks Loading Delay** ‚ùå
**Problem**: Breaks loaded 1 second after the timetable became visible, causing a jarring user experience.

**Root Cause**: No loading state for breaks, so users saw empty slots briefly before breaks appeared.

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Firestore Rules** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED
**Solution**: Separated create, update, and delete permissions:

```javascript
// AFTER (Fixed)
match /appointments/{appointmentId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null; // All authenticated users can read
  allow create: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId; // Users can create appointments for themselves
  allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
    (request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId || 
     get(/databases/$(database)/documents/user_profiles/$(request.auth.uid)).data.isDietician == true ||
     get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.isDietician == true);
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Users can create appointments for themselves
- Users can only update/delete their own appointments
- Dieticians can manage all appointments
- Security is maintained

### 2. **Added Breaks Loading State** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
**Solution**: Implemented loading state for breaks:

```typescript
// Added loading state
const [breaksLoading, setBreaksLoading] = React.useState(true);

// Set loading to false when breaks are loaded
unsubscribe = firestore.collection('breaks').onSnapshot(snapshot => {
  const breaksData = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
    id: doc.id,
    ...doc.data()
  }));
  setBreaks(breaksData);
  setBreaksLoading(false); // ‚úÖ Set loading to false when breaks are loaded
}, error => {
  console.error('[ScheduleAppointment] Error listening to breaks:', error);
  setBreaksLoading(false); // ‚úÖ Set loading to false even on error
});

// Show loading state in UI
{isBreaksLoading ? '...' : isBreak ? 'Break' : isBooked ? (isBookedByMe ? 'Your Appt' : 'Booked') : timeSlot}
```

**Benefits**:
- Time slots show '...' while breaks are loading
- No more jarring 1-second delay
- Better user experience
- Clear loading feedback
