# Automatic Diet Extraction and Notification Refresh Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**
Ensure that when a user receives a new diet, the extraction process automatically starts in the backend, and when the user visits notification settings, they immediately see the new notifications from the new diet.

## âœ… **Improvements Made**

### **1. Backend: Automatic Extraction and Scheduling**

#### **Enhanced Diet Upload Endpoint**
**File**: `backend/server.py` - `/users/{user_id}/diet/upload`

**Before**: Only extracted notifications but didn't schedule them
```python
# Extract notifications from the new diet PDF
notifications = diet_notification_service.extract_and_create_notifications(
    user_id, file.filename, firestore_db
)

if notifications:
    # Store notifications in Firestore
    user_notifications_ref.set({
        "diet_notifications": notifications,
        "extracted_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "diet_pdf_url": file.filename
    }, merge=True)
```

**After**: Automatically extracts AND schedules notifications
```python
# Extract notifications from the new diet PDF
notifications = diet_notification_service.extract_and_create_notifications(
    user_id, file.filename, firestore_db
)

if notifications:
    # Store notifications in Firestore
    user_notifications_ref.set({
        "diet_notifications": notifications,
        "extracted_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "diet_pdf_url": file.filename
    }, merge=True)
    
    # Automatically schedule the notifications
    try:
        scheduler = get_notification_scheduler(firestore_db)
        scheduled_count = await scheduler.schedule_user_notifications(user_id)
        print(f"Successfully scheduled {scheduled_count} notifications for user {user_id}")
    except Exception as schedule_error:
        print(f"Error scheduling notifications for user {user_id}: {schedule_error}")
        # Don't fail the upload if scheduling fails
```

### **2. Frontend: Automatic Notification Refresh**

#### **Enhanced Notification Settings Screen**
**File**: `mobileapp/screens.tsx` - `NotificationSettingsScreen`

**Added Features**:

1. **Focus Listener**: Refreshes notifications when screen comes into focus
```typescript
// Refresh diet notifications when screen comes into focus
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener('focus', () => {
    console.log('[Diet Notifications] Screen focused, refreshing diet notifications');
    loadDietNotifications();
  });

  return unsubscribe;
}, [navigation]);
```

2. **New Diet Notification Listener**: Automatically refreshes when user receives new diet
```typescript
// Handle new diet notifications - automatically refresh diet notifications
if (data?.type === 'new_diet') {
  console.log('[Diet Notifications] Received new diet notification, refreshing diet notifications');
  // Refresh diet notifications to show the newly extracted notifications
  await loadDietNotifications();
}
```

3. **Existing Load on Mount**: Already loads notifications when component mounts
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  loadNotifications();
  loadDietNotifications(); // This loads diet notifications on mount
  // ... permission requests
}, []);
```

## ðŸ”„ **Complete Flow**

### **1. Diet Upload Process**
```
1. Dietician uploads new diet PDF
   â†“
2. Backend uploads to Firebase Storage
   â†“
3. Backend extracts notifications from PDF
   â†“
4. Backend stores notifications in Firestore
   â†“
5. Backend automatically schedules notifications
   â†“
6. Backend sends push notification to user: "New Diet Has Arrived!"
```

### **2. User Experience**
```
1. User receives push notification: "New Diet Has Arrived!"
   â†“
2. User opens notification settings
   â†“
3. Frontend automatically loads latest diet notifications
   â†“
4. User sees all newly extracted notifications
   â†“
5. Notifications are already scheduled and ready to go
```

### **3. Automatic Refresh Triggers**
```
1. Screen Focus: When user navigates to notification settings
2. New Diet Notification: When user receives "New Diet Has Arrived!" notification
3. Component Mount: When notification settings screen loads
```
